# Project Name: üêß Penguin Fashion

# Project Description:
Penguin Fashion is a simple, responsive static clothing website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. This is my seventh web project, but my first time using Tailwind.
I made my previous six projects using raw CSS, and I really love how Tailwind works. I started by learning Tailwind from its documentation, and then built this project.
I think Tailwind saved me a lot of time and effort compared to writing raw CSS. I finished this project with just 392 lines of code. In my previous projects, 
I followed a similar UI design in Figma, and I remember writing 300-400 lines of CSS code just to complete the project. So, I really enjoyed using Tailwind!

# What I newly learned while building this project:
* How to build fully responsive layouts with Tailwind classes
* Git Conventional Commits: I also learned how to write clear and meaningful commit messages using the Conventional Commits format.
